    <h1>Future Vacation Plans</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Now that my friends and family are older and have career driven jobs there are many more vacation in the works. We want to go to places 
        like Hawaii, Japan, New Zealand, and many other places.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2>Hawaii</h2>
    <p>This is the next vacation we plan on doing, I love the Hawaiian culture so we want to do a healthy mix of relaxing with adventure.  
    </p><br>

    <h2>Japan</h2>
    <p> This is place that I personally have wanted to go since I was young. I want to see all the advanced technology, Nintendo world, Mt.Fuji, 
        experience the hotsprings, and enjoy all the food.
    </p><br>
    <br>

    <h2>New Zealand</h2>
    <p>I've had family members vacation here and they never wanted to come back. Because of the vacation they had in New Zealand their life goals changed 
        to find a way to move there permanently. The experience for them was one of the greatest they had, and so, I need to go there and experience 
        the feeling they had.
