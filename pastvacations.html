    <h1>The Road So Far</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Still relatively young but we made our way to a few great places including Cozumel Mexico, Colorado Springs Colorado, Galveston/Houstan Texas.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2>Cozumel Mexico</h2>
    <p>Cozumel was the first vaction I ever had. I was 15 my family and I took a cruise from Orlando, Florida to the Florida Keys. 
        From there we went to Cozumel, Mexico. The Carinval Cruise line was a great experience with a ton of things to do on the ship. 
        The Keys was a great Island full of non-domesticated Chickens. Cozumel was very catered towards tourist, but even still we were able to 
        do fun things like swim with dolphins.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Colorado Springs, Colorado</h2>
    <p>First vacation I went with my significant other. Took a spring break vacations in our early 20s. We were poor so instead of doing tourist 
        attraction stuff we went the adventurous route. This ended up being my favorite Vacation. We saw the Garden of The Gods which is one of 
        the most beautiful places that exist. We also went into some of the biggest cave systems in the U.S.
    </p><br>
    <br>

    <h2>Galveston/Houston, Texas</h2>
    <p>The past two vacations have been in Texas, first in Galveston, then in Houston the following year. Galeveston was the definition of a vacation. 
        We had a hotel right on the beach front and we spent 10 days on the Gulf of Mexico drinking Tequila Sunrises and swimming in the ocean water. 
        The Following year we went to Houston and just experienced all the Houston had to offer. We went to the museums, ate various food, wandered 
        the various major areas.
